# Remodeling
We're rewriting the original wiki as a single-page application.

Write privileges were withdrawn in 2015 after a disgruntled visitor threatened automated destruction.
We described the situation then in one of our usual system notices.

We were closed completely for one week this year with the following explanation. We're open now and continuing to improve.

# Process
We will focus on restoring some service as soon as possible. Then advance a broader agenda in several more stages.
Throughtout our remodel we will focus on simple implementation with minimum dependencies
requiring the least attention in years ahead.

- [return wiki to 95% service](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/1) ✔︎
- [full service static site](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/2)
- [integrate with read-write federated wiki pods](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/3)

# Website
We have a new site running and available for browsing.
Review our checklists above to align your expectations.
We're aware of missing data and all formatting is provisional.
