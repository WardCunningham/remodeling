# remodeling
We're rewriting the original wiki as a single page application.

Write privilages were withdrawn in 2015 after a disgruntled visitor threatened automated distruction.
We described the situation then in one of our usual system notices.

We were closed completely for one week this year with the following explaination. We're open now and continuing to improve.

# process
We will focus on restoring some service as soon as possible. Then advance a broader agenda in several more stages.
Throughtout our remodel we will focus on simple implementation with minimum dependencies
requiring the least attention in years ahead.

- [return wiki to 95% service](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/1) ✔︎
- [full service static site](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/2)
- [integrate with read-write federated wiki pods](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/3)

# website
